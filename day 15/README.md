# Swapped Adder
 
### Task 1:
Remember when you had to sum fractions by hand all those years ago? You'll do something of the sort today.
 
Write a function named adder that takes in an array of fractions represented as strings and returns the sum of these fractions as a string with the numerator and denominator in their simplest form. For example, if the parameter passed to the function adder was [ '2/21', '1/9', '8/63'] then the function should return '1/3'.
Also, adder(['1/2','1/3','1/6']) returns '1/1'.
 
### Task 2:
 
Write a function named swap that takes in 2 variables and swaps their content without the use of temporary variables, tuple comparison or Arithmetic operators. 
a=8
b=9
swap(a,b) returns 9,8
