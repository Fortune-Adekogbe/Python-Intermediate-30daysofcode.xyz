# DAY 2: TERMINO

Write a function named **termino** that takes in a **string of parentheses** and returns the **minimum number of parentheses to be removed** to make the string valid as an integer <br>(i.e. each open parenthesis is closed).

For example, given the string `"()())()"`, you should return `1`. Given the string `")("`, you should return` 2` since we must remove all of them.
