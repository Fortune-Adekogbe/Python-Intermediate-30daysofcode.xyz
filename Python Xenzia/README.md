# Python Xenzia

Official Solution to a task set for the Python Intermediate track of the 30DaysofCode Cohort 2.

## Question


As Pythonistas, how better to end this beautiful challenge than to make a snake game?

Remember that snake game you used to play on Nokia 3310? Yeah, That's our task for today. 

# Here are the functionalities your game should have:

# A set number of lives. 
Your snake is dead if it touches a wall or itself. The walls are of course the four sides of the playing background but if you've played the game before, you'd know that you can be more creative if you choose to be.

# Levels. 
After each level, the snake should grow and move faster to increase difficulty. 
You can either set a limit on the number of levels or pick a level beyond which conditions become constant. 
The player should level up if his snake eats a certain number of berries. 

# Display.
Display the rules for your game like keys to press and level up conditions at the start of the game and  a game over alongsides instructions to restart when the user uses up his lives.

Yes, the game should be able to restart without re-running the app. 
A map.txt file set for a (640, 480) display can be seen as a file in this repo. Also images for the wall, snake and berry are included. You can decide to use these or not.

#Goodluck
